# Python Web Scraper
Simple html webscraper template made for newegg.ca. Writes scraped data into a microsoft excel doc. Was made fairly quickly to compare cpu prices between AMD and Intel during a store sale. Resulting in not being as robust as it should be. However, scaling this script should be easy and I'll come back to it when I have time.
